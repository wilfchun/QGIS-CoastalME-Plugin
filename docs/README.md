## Key Concepts

### QGIS Plugin Architecture
- **Plugin Entry Point**: `coastalmeqgis_menu.py` - Main plugin class
- **Dock Widgets**: Persistent UI panels (like the results viewer)
- **Data Providers**: Handle specific file formats and data types
- **Signal/Slot System**: Event-driven communication between components
- **Layer Management**: Integration with QGIS map layers and visualization

### Results Viewer System
- **TuView**: Main viewer dock widget (to be renamed CmeView)
- **TuResults**: Central results management (to be renamed CmeResults)
- **TuPlot**: Matplotlib-based plotting system (to be renamed CmePlot)
- **Time Management**: Synchronization across all visualization components
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles various result file formats

### Data Handling
- **2D Results**: Mesh-based data (depths, velocities, etc.)
- **1D Results**: Network-based data (flows, levels, etc.)
- **Particles**: Particle tracking visualization
- **Time Series**: Temporal data handling and animation
- **Cross-sections**: 1D profile visualization

## Migration Summary

The migration from TUFLOW to CoastalME involves:

1. **Systematic Renaming**: 29 core files, hundreds of classes and functions
2. **Branding Updates**: All user-visible text and interface elements
3. **Functionality Preservation**: All features must work exactly as before
4. **Code Quality**: Maintain same structure and performance
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive validation after each phase

### Estimated Timeline
- **Analysis and Planning**: 1-2 days âœ“
- **File Structure Migration**: 2-3 days
- **Code Refactoring**: 5-7 days
- **Data Adaptation**: 3-4 days
- **Testing and Validation**: 3-5 days

**Total**: 14-21 days

## Tools and Resources

### Development Environment
- **QGIS 3.6+**: Required for plugin development
- **Python 3.6+**: Plugin programming language
- **PyQt5/PyQt6**: UI framework
- **Git**: Version control (essential for migration)

### External Libraries
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **NetCDF4**: NetCDF file handling
- **H5py**: HDF5 file handling

### Testing Tools
- **pytest**: Unit testing framework
- **QGIS Testing Framework**: Integration testing
- **Mock Data**: Test datasets for validation

## Contributing

When working on this plugin:

1. **Follow the Migration Guide**: Use the systematic approach outlined
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Each phase should be validated before proceeding
3. **Document Changes**: Update documentation as you make modifications
4. **Maintain Backups**: Always have a rollback plan
5. **Version Control**: Use git branches for migration work

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Import Errors**: Check import paths after file renaming
- **UI Elements Missing**: Verify signal connections after class renaming
- **Performance Issues**: Check data caching and memory management
- **Test Failures**: Update test files with new naming conventions

### Migration-Specific Issues
- **Incomplete Renaming**: Use search/replace tools systematically
- **Broken Functionality**: Test each component after renaming
- **Settings Issues**: Update QSettings keys consistently
- **Documentation Gaps**: Ensure all references are updated

## Conclusion

This documentation provides everything needed to understand and successfully migrate the QGIS-CoastalME-Plugin from TUFLOW to CoastalME. The systematic approach ensures that all functionality is preserved while completely rebranding the plugin for CoastalME use.

The migration is substantial but manageable when following the phased approach outlined in the documentation. The key is to be systematic, test thoroughly, and maintain the high quality of the existing codebase.
